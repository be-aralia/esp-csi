/** @mainpage ESP Radar Console Test
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the esp_radar component to process
 * Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for presence detection. CSI frames are
 * collected from a router or another ESP32 transmitter and analysed to obtain
 * two metrics:
 * - **waveform_wander**: long term variation of CSI amplitude.
 * - **waveform_jitter**: short term fluctuation of CSI.
 *
 * The application filters these metrics over a sliding window. Wander is used
 * to decide if someone is present while jitter indicates movement. Thresholds
 * and sensitivities can be tuned via the console or the accompanying Python GUI
 * tool. Processed results are printed in `RADAR_DATA` CSV format and can be
 * visualised in real time.
